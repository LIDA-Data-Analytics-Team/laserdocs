	- There will then be two or three options available: Summarized data, Underlying data and occasionally Data with current layout

	**Summarized data** has two types of file formats and different size limits.

	**Underlying data** uses only .csv file format with 30,000 max rows limitation.

	**Data with current layout** is a new option as of November 2021 that allows the export of data from a table or matrix visual to Excel while preserving the formatting.
