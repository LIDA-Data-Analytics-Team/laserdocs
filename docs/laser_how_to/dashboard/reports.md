# Power BI Reports

## Landing Page
The Landing page provides an overview of LASER. As with all of the reports it is based on user access permissions, with a user able to see an overview of all projects they have access to. A user can go to ‘Project name’ slicer at the top of the report to slice data to a single or multiple projects (multiple projects can be selected with Ctrl+ Click).

## User Information
The User information page lists the user membership of specific LASER research projects. By default, the table shows all members of all the projects a logged in user has access to. But this can be sliced as required by using the ‘Project name’ slicer at the top of the report.

## VM Usage
VM Usage report details the Start and Stop (Deallocation) times of the virtual machines (VM’s). By default, the table shows all start and deallocate times of all VMs a researcher has access to. But this can be sliced as required by using the ‘Project name’ slicer at the top of the report.
This data can be exported and using offline tools joined with the data from the ‘Project costs’ report to build a picture of which resources have incurred costs and when. 

## Project costs
The Project cost report has two views, a user can switch between a chart view and a table view by clicking on chart or table buttons. As the name suggests, this page shows the costs over time of all projects and project resources a researcher has access to. You can drill up and down into the data and slice it using any of the 3 slicers at the top of the report.

## Cost and Budget
Cost and budget also has two views. User can switch between a chart view and a table view by clicking on chart or table buttons. This report gives a view of Azure project spend and forecast data based on the budget data and project dates in the Azure Portal.

## Resource cost
Resource cost report gives a summary of all resource costs over time. You can drill up and down into the data and slice it using any of the 3 slicers at the top of the report.
