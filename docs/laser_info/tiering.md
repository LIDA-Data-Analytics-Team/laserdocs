## LASER Data Risk Tiering

Data providers often classify their data (e.g. personally identifiable, pseudonymised, anonymous) and share it based on a set of firm requirements detailed in a ‘Data Sharing Agreement’ (DSA). That would set the minimum standards of security required. LIDA and/or PI/researcher may have a view that the data is more sensitive and want more assurance than the provider contractually requires.

The following data risk classification tiers have been adopted from the Alan Turing Institute and are used to assess the data and associated risks.

### Data Risk Tier - Disclosure Impact

|Tier 0	|Tier 1	|Tier 2	|Tier 3	|Tier 4	|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**No impact on UoL**, partners or data subjects	|**Low impact** on UoL; legal penalty or damage to reputation highly unlikely. |**Medium impact** on UoL or partners leading to legal, commercial, contractual, financial penalty or damage to reputation. |**High impact** to UoL, partners or data subjects with potential for contractual, commercial, legal, financial or reputational penalties.	|**Significant impact** to UoL, partners or individuals with potential for substantial legal, financial or reputational penalties.|
|	|**No impact** on partners or data subjects |**Limited impact** on data subjects |	|	|

### Data Risk Tier - LASER Description

|Tier 0	|Tier 1	|Tier 2	|Tier 3	|Tier 4	|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Information that does not require any protections. |Not Personal Data - Confidence in the quality of the anonymisation is absolute. |Identifiable personal data which does not include special categories of data or link to special categories of data held elsewhere in the University of Leeds. |**Special categories of personal data or data collected under a duty of confidentiality** where disclosure poses **a threat** to personal safety, security, health or wellbeing: <br/>The data is: <br/>Weakly pseudonymised but does not contain direct identifiers, therefore poses little risk of unauthorised person viewing data e.g. over the shoulder of LASER. |**Special categories of personal data or data collected under a duty of confidentiality** where disclosure poses a **substantial threat** to personal safety, security, health or wellbeing: <br/>The data is: <br/>Directly identifiable |
|	|OR |OR |OR |AND/OR |
||Disclosive data where release/sharing was explicitly agreed in consent and fully described in participant information. |Pseudonymised or synthetic data where confidence in the quality of anonymisation is strong. This can be interpreted as: <br/>- Data provided by reputable 3rd party organisation where the 3rd party organisation holds the salt / pseudonymisation key <br/>- Data which is derived from personal data but it would not be possible to re-identify individuals from the data using any reasonable mechanisms available to the authorised user.|Robustly pseudonymised where individuals could be identified indirectly through combination with other information which is not easily available to the person accessing the information but could be available if the individual accessing the data were motivated to e.g. only protected by professional standards.|Commercial or governmental data which is sensitive or likely to be subject to attack by attackers with bounded capabilities, such as hacktivists. |
|	|AND |AND/OR |AND/OR |AND/OR |
||Datasets where the only risk of disclosure is assisting the researcher’s competitors.||Commercial or governmental data which is sensitive or likely to be subject to attack by attackers with bounded capabilities, such as hacktivists. |Consent, ethical or contractual restrictions controlling how the data is handled. |
|	|	|Confidential project documents restricted by ethical, legal or contractual obligations. |AND/OR |OR |
||||Ethical, commercial or contractual restrictions controlling how the data is handled. |Weakly pseudonymised – real world identifiers remain which could be combined with other information easily available to the person accessing the information. |
